<!-- Welcome to PseudoChannel! 

This will be the most difficult part in the process of setting up your PseudoChannel (but it is not hard, 
just be sure to read this and you will be set). 

There are a few things to keep in mind when setting up this XML. 

1) What exactly is this file for? 

The whole idea behind "PseudoChannel.py" is to create your own channel(s) to mimick real TV,
using your own "TV Shows", "Movies" and "Commercials". You are not supposed to intervene too often,
rather you are supposed to set it up (here) and just let it go as it advances in series episodes, playing
commercials to fill up gaps between scheduled content and playing movies where specified. That being said, 
this particular file is where you map out what your channel looks like. I have my own schedule 
below so you can reference it when building your own channel. 

2) How do I make sense of these '<time></time>' blocks / '<weekdays></weekdays' blocks?

Since the whole concept of the channel is to have repeating blocks of content that changes throughout the
week depending on the day / time of day (like a real channel) you specify your "TV Shows" and "Movies" schedule
by adding a '<time></time>' block within the part of the week you want it to be scheduled for. For instance, 
below I have "Looney Tunes" scheduled to play "everyday" starting at "6:00 AM", whereas I have "Garfield &#38; Friends"
playing only on "weekday" mornings scheduled for after Looney Tunes starting at "8:00 AM". Also notice that
"Garfield &#38; Friends" below is actually written as, "Garfield &#38; Friends". This is especially important
to those new to editing XML. In XML, "UTF-8", you are forbidden from using certain characters like the "&#38;"
character. It is important to convert your titles to XML friendly text (this is also important for non-english characters).
You can find all of this information by googling "xml ascii character conversion".

3) Setting the available parameters: "title=", "type=", "strict-time=", "time-shift=", "xtra="

There are two required parameters: "title" and "type". The "title" value should be either the title of your series
(i.e. "Friends") or if you are scheduling a movie it should only be set to, "random". The "type" parameter should be set
to either "series" or "movie". The attribute "strict-time" can either be "true" or "false" and refers to 
whether or not the particular "<time>" block will be scheduled for the exact time you specify or if it will 
shift around to fill up gaps. This is useful as sometimes episodes are as short as 5 minutes (cartoons) while
other episodes that are normally ~25 minutes are an hour or so long. Setting "strict-time" to "false" will
tell the app to movie that time block closer to the previous episode. The corrisponding, "time-shift" attribute
tells the app how to shift the item. Its value can be "1" or more and will help the scheduler determine when to schedule the 
shifting time according to that value. So for instance, if you'd like no gaps between your content, then you want 
to set "strict-time='false'" and "time-shift='1'". However if you want your content to shift but would rather
it 'hook' on to a pretty time, like "2:45 PM" versus "2:41 PM" then you would set "time-shift" to a value like "5".
This will shift content around and schedule it within 5 minutes of the previous item but hook it on to the 
nearest multiple of "5". You could use "15" or "30" too for even prettier times. Experiment. 

4) Movies. How do I schedule "Billy Madison" to play on Saturday afternoon? 

Well, since the app is supposed to work like a real TV Channel, you aren't supposed to have that kind of
control. If you want to watch "Billy Madison" then why not just turn on your Plex TV app and play it? Instead
here you want to always use "random" tor the "title=" value. But let's say you have a ton of Adam Sandler
movies and want to schedule a "random" Adam Sandler movie on Saturday afternoon? That makes more sense, that way
you aren't playing the same movie every Saturday afternoon! For movies specifically, you have a new 
attribute called "xtra". There you can add various parameters to narrow in on the random movie type you
want scheduled every Saturday afternoon. So if for some reason you are set on playing an Adam Sandler comedy
every Saturday, then you might have a <time> block that looks like this:

<time title="random" type="movie" strict-time="true" xtra='actor:adam sandler genre:comedy contentRating:PG'>12:45 PM</time>

The available "xtra" paramters are as follows (http://python-plexapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/plexapi/library.html#LibrarySection.search):

* unwatched: Display or hide unwatched content (True, False). [all]
* duplicate: Display or hide duplicate items (True, False). [movie]
* actor: List of actors to search ([actor_or_id, ...]). [movie]
* collection: List of collections to search within ([collection_or_id, ...]). [all]
* contentRating: List of content ratings to search within ([rating_or_key, ...]). [movie,tv]
* country: List of countries to search within ([country_or_key, ...]). [movie,music]
* decade: List of decades to search within ([yyy0, ...]). [movie]
* director: List of directors to search ([director_or_id, ...]). [movie]
* genre: List Genres to search within ([genere_or_id, ...]). [all]
* network: List of TV networks to search within ([resolution_or_key, ...]). [tv]
* resolution: List of video resolutions to search within ([resolution_or_key, ...]). [movie]
* studio: List of studios to search within ([studio_or_key, ...]). [music]
* year: List of years to search within ([yyyy, ...]). [all]

Currently the "xtra" attribute is only available to be used with movies. 

5) Commercials? 

If you are planning on using "time-shift" with a value greater than "1", then you will have empty gaps
in between your scheduled content. A neat feature is to fill those gaps with commercials, music videos, 
or whatever you can come up with. All you have to do is set the commercial flag in the "pseudo_config.py"
file to tell the app to use "commercial injection" and make sure you have a "Commercials" library in your
plex media library. In that library, fill it with as many commercials or short videos as you can. The more
the better! I have close to a thousand commercials in mine - this helps the app fill up the gaps with a 
wide variety of video content of different durations. (hint: use a tool like 'youtube-dl' to download full 
playlists from yourtube. You can fill up your "Commercials" library quick). Once you have your commercials library
setup, make sure to run, "python PseudoChannel.py -u" once more to update your local db with your new commercials
library. Commercials will now be "injected" to fill up gaps upon the next days schedule (or you can manually
generate the schedule using the "-g" flag).

Ok, that should be it. I've made it sound much more complicated than it actually is. Just make sure that you aren't
accidentally overlapping times, aren't accidentally trying to use forbidden XML characters, etc. Once you have 
everything set, it should be hands off form there on out. Just go back to the cli and run "python PseudoChannel.py -xml"
to tell the app that you have updated the XML. 

Oh and lastly, make sure that your "series" title's are written exactly as they are in your Plex Library. So if you 
have "The Office (us)" in your Plex library, you need to have it written exactly like that here (not case sensitive) or it won't work. In
my previous "garfield" example you might be tempted to write it as "Garfield and Friends" instead of the hassle of
using the XML ascii character "&#38;". Well you cannot do that. I usually like to have my Plex Server web page
open in a tab while making my XML. That way for each "series" title I can double check the library to make sure I 
am using the series title exactly as Plex is. 

Ok, that is it. If you have questions feel free to e-mail me at justin@pseudochannel.tv. Have fun!

Cheers!
